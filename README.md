# Scripts

This repository contains all of my scripts. Most of them are shell scripts written in POSIX sh.

## OVERVIEW

NOTE: A lot of the scripts (most of the ones in misc) won't always be up to date, as I use and change them quite frequently. The scripts that aren't in misc are the ones that people ask me about a lot.

#### autoclicker.sh

This is a simple autoclicker. It uses `xdotool` and `zenity`.

#### err.sh

This is a "virus".

### err_but_better.sh

When I wrote ``err.sh``, I was not very good at making shell scripts. A few months later, I rewrote it to make it better in general.

#### mahir.sh

best script in world 12345 amazing

#### wg.sh

This script uses wget to download an image, and then open it in mpv (read the comments inside of the script for some information).

### Misc

* bsp{bord,gaps,lay} - change border size, layout and gap size in my window manager (bspwm)

* bspconf - choose from previous 3 scripts

* dmconf - edit misc configuration files

* kill - restart some programs that I restart a lot, usually to reload configs

* random-manpage - open a random man (manual) page (good for learning)

* term-spam - opens **a lot** of terminal windows, and then closes all of them

* zenity-manpdf - choose a man page and then open it as a pdf
