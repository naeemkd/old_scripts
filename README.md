# Scripts

This repository contains all of my scripts. Most of them are shell scripts written in POSIX sh.

## OVERVIEW

#### autoclicker.sh

This is a simple autoclicker. It uses `xdotool` and `zenity`.

#### err.sh

This is a "virus".

#### wg.sh

This script uses wget to download an image, and then open it in mpv (read the comments inside of the script for some information).
