# Scripts

This repository contains all of my scripts. Most of them are shell scripts written in POSIX sh.

## TO-DO
* Move ~/.scripts folder from dotfiles repo to here

## OVERVIEW

#### .scripts folder
These are scripts that I use regularly. They used to be on my dotfiles repository (which is private), but I moved then to this one.

They won't always be up to date, as I change them quite frequently.

#### autoclicker.sh

This is a simple autoclicker. It uses `xdotool` and `zenity`.

#### err.sh

This is a "virus".

#### mahir.sh

best script in world 12345 amazing

#### wg.sh

This script uses wget to download an image, and then open it in mpv (read the comments inside of the script for some information).
